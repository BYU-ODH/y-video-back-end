credentials for dev postgresql database:
  username: y-video
  password: 12345
credentials for test postgresql database:
  username: y-video-test
  password: 12345

Next steps:
  Define complete database in SQL (at least, complete based on OpenAPI spec)
  Define all query, update, etc. functions  in SQL
  Get all dummy routes in place

Reference:
  To launch postresql as user:
    sudo -u y-video psql
  In postgres:
    \d or \dt - show tables
    SQL statements must end in ;

Questions for Front-End:
      Does content only belong to 1 collection? (probably yes)
      What are files, and are we storing those in the DB, disk, or remotely?
  How are you accessing react?
  Which files are you storing/serving/accessing locally?
  Difference between '/collections/{col_id}/content/{con_id}' and '/content/{id}'?
  How are we handling authentication?
  Does updating collections and content imply deleting relations not listed in request body?
  How are we going to update collections, content, etc?

Other Thoughts:
  For DB, instead of lists, do many-to-many table with extra columns
  User is now Account, Word is now TWord (keywords in postgres)
