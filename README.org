#+TITLE: Quick CLJ Setup
A fast CLJS setup for BYU ODH applications. 

* The Stack
With this setup, the features/stack are as follows:

- Tests set up for TDD
  - Stories for use elaboration
  - Unit tests for coverage
- A setup expecting deployment on a shared server

- [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]] as a SPA state-management framework upon react.js
- [[https://github.com/metosin/reitit][reitit]] for front-end and back-end routing
- [[https://github.com/tolitius/cprop/blob/master/README.md][cprop]] for inclusion of local and environmental variables
- [[https://github.com/tolitius/mount][mount]] for a component/reloaded workflow
- Configured for Postgresql database specified in your config.edn (see below)
- [[https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp][hikari-cp]] for JDBC database connection pooling 
- [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][hiccup]] for SSR (server-rendered) base-page
- CSS with [[https://github.com/noprompt/garden][garden]] and [[https://github.com/Otann/garden-gnome][garden-gnome]] for hot-reloading as you define your styles as unadorned clojure
- [[https://github.com/yogthos/migratus][migratus]] for database initialization and migrations
- [[https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel][figwheel]] for state-preserving hot-reloading of the browser as soon as you save a change in a cljs file

Other configuration based on [[http://www.luminusweb.net/][luminus]] 

* Getting Started
The =rename.sh= script expects you to be using a system with =grep=, =sed=, =find= and =rename= commands installed.

1. acquire this repo
2. =cd REPO-DIR=
3. =chmod +x rename.sh=
4. execute =./rename.sh <MY-DESIRED-PROJECT-NAME>= to reconfigure all the paths the way you want
5. =cp env/dev/resources/config_sample.edn env/dev/resources/config.edn=  and edit config.edn to specify database credentials, startup port, and any other environmental state your app will refer utilize. 

At this point you are welcome to use =lein run= to start the server; you will now be able to view the application by pointing a browser to =http://localhost:3030=. 

=lein figwheel start= will then start the front-end hotloading as you edit cljs files.
