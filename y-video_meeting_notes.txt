Questions for Front-End:
      Does content only belong to 1 collection? (probably yes)
      What are files, and are we storing those in the DB, disk, or remotely?
  How are you accessing react?
  Which files are you storing/serving/accessing locally?
  Difference between '/collections/{col_id}/content/{con_id}' and '/content/{id}'?
  How are we handling authentication?
  Does updating collections and content imply deleting relations not listed in request body?
  How are we going to update collections, content, etc?

Routes to add:
 - admin?


New Questions:
  How will you use the collections post? i.e. is that where you create courses,
    users, content, or are they created prior via another route?

Do you ever need to access a course by itself? (i.e. not in relation to a collection)
  create, retrieve, update, and delete
