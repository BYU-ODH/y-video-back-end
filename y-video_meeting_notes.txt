When you request a collection, do you need info about all its users, courses, and/or content?
    Or just the collection data, i.e. name, published, archived?

DONE ** Add filters field to content, string? **
** Change collection-content to many to many **
** Add annotation object, many to many as filter over content? **
DONE ** Auto-generate diagram from init.sql? **
