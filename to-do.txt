To do before Sep 2020:

1. Use an API to tag users as instructors or students, and then filter for admins and lab assistants
    - Currently, everyone is just labeled as an admin

2. Implement single-use session-id tokens (aka auth-tokens)
    - We are currently just using user-ids directly.

3. Make session-id-bypass testing/development only

4. Restrict user access to each endpoint (via session-id)
    - This is partially built, but currently disabled.

5. Serve public login screen with access to public data (collections, resources, etc.)
    - Either need to update how we're filtering through CAS, or separately host login page

6. Add is-public field to db tables for resources, contents, collections

7. Add functionality to access public data without authentication

8. Potentially add csrf prevention to api routes
