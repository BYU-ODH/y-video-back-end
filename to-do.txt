To do before Sep 2020:

1. Use an API to tag users as instructors or students, and then filter for admins and lab assistants
    - Currently, everyone is just labeled as an admin

2. Implement single-use session-id tokens (aka auth-tokens)
    - We are currently just using user-ids directly.
    - Update - implemented on back end, ready for front end to begin using
    - Update - done

3. Make session-id-bypass testing/development only

4. Restrict user access to each endpoint (via session-id)
    - This is partially built, but currently disabled.

5. Serve public login screen with access to public data (collections, resources, etc.)
    - Either need to update how we're filtering through CAS, or separately host login page
    - Low priority

6. Add public field to db tables for resources, contents, collections
    - Low priority
    - Update - added to database and models
    - Update - removed until future development

7. Add functionality to access public data without authentication
    - Low priority
    - Update - get by id and get all for collections, contents, resources done

8. Potentially add csrf prevention to api routes
